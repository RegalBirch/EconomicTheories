        Although each economic theory has progressed the field of economics, not every economic theory stands the test of time or real world scenarios. Keynesian economics, however, has consistently been employed since its beginnings in the Great Depression. The Great Depression was the worst economic recession the United States had ever faced and Keynesian economics through heavy government intervention was able to pull the United States out of it. More recently, the 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic saw Keynesian inspired stimulus in order to prevent the United States from falling into a deeper recession. Rather than letting the economy self correct over a long period of time, Keynesian economics takes matters into its own hands and directly confronts recessions. The ability of the Keynesian school of thought to apply itself to real world scenarios and continue to do so since the Great Depression makes it the most effective economic theory.
