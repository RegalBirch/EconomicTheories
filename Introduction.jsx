          What is Economics?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Economics is the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It explores how individuals, businesses, governments, and nations make choices about allocating scarce resources to satisfy their wants and needs. As such, many economic theories have been proposed that attempt to explain the most effective method of allocation.
